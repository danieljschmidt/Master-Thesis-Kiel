\chapter{Code manual}

code is attached to the thesis (with data, partially) and also on github

\section{Used programming languages and packages}

% TODO make clear where I use material of others
% TODO point out versions

Mostly matlab (2017b), no toolboxes (betarnd???) or functions from someone else (?)\\

Standard library (os, time, xml, urllib)
Modified version of the fredapi library (Apache License 2.0 allows modification)
quandl
pandas for data analysis\\

julia for plots
packages: Gadfly (and the packages that are in turn required by these packages)\\

\section{Instructions on how to replicate the results}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item download and prepare data with script in python folder (stored in data folder)
	\item run forecast experiments with scripts in the matlab/forecast\_experiment folder (stored in data\_mcmc folder)
	\item generate the relevant data for tables and plots with the scripts in analysis, data is stored in data\_plots and data\_tables (prelimary Matlab figures can be viewed as well)
	\item generate figures with scripts in the julia folder
\end{enumerate}
