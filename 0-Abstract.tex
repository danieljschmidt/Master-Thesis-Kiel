\section*{Acknowledgement}

In June, I had the opportunity to present a very preliminary version of this thesis in the course ``Statistical Modeling and Programming'' taught by Mariia Okuneva and Felix Kie√üner. I would like to thank both Mariia and Felix for their useful comments after the presentation. In particular, I thank Mariia for recommending \citet{ZhouEtal2014} and \citet{Thorsrud2016b} and Felix for noting that the roots of the MA lag polynomial $\frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} L + L^2 + \frac{2}{3}L^3 + \frac{1}{3}L^4$ lie on the unit circle.
